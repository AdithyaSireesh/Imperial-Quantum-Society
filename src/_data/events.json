    "duration_unit": "hour &#10 each",
    "content": "We will give an overview of QML. From the basics of machine learning, through a quick reminder of quantum computation, to the very heart of QML. We will have an hands-on “Hello World” tutorial. Together, we will install all the necessary components and packages to run a QML algorithm on a real quantum device from your own laptop !. In the second session go through two leading QML algorithms : Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN).",
